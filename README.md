I want to develop an engaging an Canberra Modern website. which will be inclue some event , information about canberra in the past and present. to make it feeling like a memories and history, i I intended to create my website with a basic and beautiful design using a colour scheme of black, white. After doing research and analysing several websites across different sectors, I have seen that the majority of websites include a header positioned at the top of the page that remains fixed at the top of the browser window when scrolling. and  those websites are responsive and can adapt to various screen sizes. 


Initially, I created my website with the navigation bar which can lead viewers to the section that shows on the bar. Moreover, instead of creating the navigation bar that sticks on top, create the up button in the right corner of the devices so that they can click on that button and come back to the first page. In the first page, I put the images of Canberra as a wellcome viewers to Canberra. In the second page, I use display Flexbox to autoscale the screen which can adjust the display suite with various devices. In the third section , I changed the layout that put the images in the left and text in the right to make it more interesting on this website. In the last part, two images were put in two sides of the paragraph to make it balance and aesthetics as well. The final touch was adding contact, giving the website a dynamic feel. Overall, these design choices were made to create a visually engaging and user-friendly experience for visitors to the site.


Throughout the process, I had several issues with the responsiveness of the website. Initially, when I attempted to enable interaction with users by including blank space, the website functioned nicely. However, it became stuck when I added extra code to change the element on my website. Moreover, I had a misunderstanding about how media queries functioned, which hindered my ability to adapt the display screen to suit different devices. Upon discovering it, I believe it would be an excellent tool for screen display management.Media queries allow for the adjustment of website layout based on different screen sizes, making it more responsive and user-friendly. With a better understanding of how they work, I was able to optimize my website for various devices effectively. 



During the building of the responsive website, I believe that website design is an excellent method to engage visitors by clearly explaining and solving user problems. Furthermore, it also assists me in comprehending how to adapt the information for different types of gadgets.  


In addition, website design allows for a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience, ultimately leading to increased user satisfaction and retention. This adaptability across devices ensures that the website remains accessible to a wider audience. By focusing on website design during the building process, I am able to create a seamless and consistent user experience regardless of the device being used. This attention to detail ultimately contributes to the overall success and effectiveness of the responsive website.
